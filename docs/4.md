# How is artificial intelligence helpful? 
<ul>
<li> To speed up the time it takes to conduct informal reviews (normally 1-3 months) or systematic reviews (normally around ~12 months)
<li> To preserve mental bandwidth to focus on higher level tasks (e.g., critically appraising the totality of evidence)
</ul>
