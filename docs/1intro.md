# **Goal**
To accelerate research by curating high-quality AI tools, focusing on the analysis of existing datasets in fields such as epidemiology and quantitative social science.

# **Can AI accelerate research?**
Absolutely. The latest breakthroughs in AI promise to transform society. 

Consider large language models: their capabilities are remarkable, understanding complex scientific domains, engaging in meaningful conversations (even passing the Turing Test), and generating, refining, and executing sophisticated analytical code.

Yet the potential of AI to enhance academic research remains largely untapped.

# **How?**
AIâ€™s most promising aspect lies in its ability to automate mundane and repetitive tasks. This allows scientists to aim higher, pushing the boundaries of creativity, ambition, and robustness. In the future we should be able to: 
<ul>
  <li> Generate systematic literature reviews with a single click </li>
  <li> Rather than using 1 x dataset in your analysis, use multiple studies and triangulate your findings </li>
  <li> Automatically ensure that all code is provided for each paper, enabling replication </li>
  <li> Convert complex scientific articles to press releases/blogs/other forms for general audience consumption </li>
</ul>

In the short term: we predict an increasing use of AI across the entire research system, from funding to review.

In the medium to longer term: many project that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will be achieved before 2034. This could mean that science itself might be automated by AI agents!

A major challenge will be ensuring that AI goals are aligned with those of the research community. Our aim is to harness AI to complement and augment human capabilities, driving forward the frontiers of research and discovery.

# **What does this site do**
We will compile useful AI tools and, in time, recommend useful / cost-effective tools

| AI | Artificial intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines | 
| AGI | Artificial general intelligence - generally defined an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable task. This would include tasks commonly done by expert scientists.|
| LLM | Large Language Model: is an advanced artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. It learns from the patterns in data to perform tasks like text generation, translation, and question answering. LLMs use deep learning techniques, consisting of billions of parameters, enabling them to process and produce language with a high degree of fluency.|
