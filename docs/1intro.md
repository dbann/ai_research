# **Can AI speed up research?** 

Absolutely. The latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence promise to transform society. Consider large language models: their capabilities are remarkable, encompassing a deep understanding of complex scientific domains, engaging in meaningful conversations (even passing the Turing Test), and generating, refining, and executing sophisticated analytical code.

Yet, the potential of AI to enhance academic research is still largely untapped. 

AI's most promising aspect lies in its ability to automate mundane and repetitive tasks. This allows scientists to aim higher, pushing the boundaries of creativity, ambition, and thoroughness in their work.

This site is dedicated to offering essential AI tools and insights to expedite research, with a focus on analyzing existing data sets in fields such as epidemiology and quantitative social science. Here, you'll find a loosely curated collection of free resources designed to streamline your research process.

# **Could AI fully automate research?** 
Possibly in the future. Many project that AGI will be achieved before 2034. 

Our aim is to harness AI to complement and augment human capabilities, driving forward the frontiers of research and discovery.
